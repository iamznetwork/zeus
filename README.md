# Zeus

Welcome to Zeus.

## Introduction

Powered by the Zenon network, IAM-Z will provide the tools required to protect and manage both our confidential information as well as our online identity in the web 3.0 economy. From advanced password management capabilities (Zeus) including an identity vault, all the way to a fully fledged protocol for self-sovereign identities (zID), IAM-Z will facilitate the sovereignty we deserve.
